Romanes eunt domus
"Romanes go the house"
An intentionally garbled Latin phrase from Monty Python's Life of Brian. Its translation is roughly, as said by a centurion in the movie, "'People called Romanes they go the house'", but its intended meaning is "Romans, go home!" When Brian is caught vandalizing the palace walls with this phrase, rather than punish him, the centurion corrects his Latin grammar, explaining that Romanus is a second declension noun and has its plural in -i rather than -es, that ire ("to go") must be in the imperative mood to denote a command, and that domus takes the accusative case without a preposition as the object. The final result of this lesson is the correct Latin phrase Romani ite domum.
